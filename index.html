          <h1>How to play</h4>
          <p>
          <strong>1 -</strong>Understand the principles behind Minesweeper. Each Minesweeper game starts out with a grid of unmarked squares. After clicking one of these squares,
           some of the squares will disappear, some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them. It's your job to use the numbers to figure out which of
           the blank squares have mines and which are safe to click <br>
          <strong>2 -</strong>Use the mouse's left and right buttons. The mouse is the only tool that you'll need to play Minesweeper. The left mouse button is used
          to click squares that don't contain mines, while the right mouse button is used to flag squares that contain mines. <br>
          <strong>3 -</strong>Know what the numbers mean. A number on a square refers to the number of mines that are currently touching that square. For example, if there are two squares
          touching each other and one of the squares has "1" on it, you know that the square next to it has a mine beneath it.
